I am Steeven Lopez, but I go by __OppositeDragon__ almost everywhere on the internet. I am a senior software engineering student, with a passion for solving problems. My favorite language is Dart, and really like working with Flutter. Since I enjoy working with Flutter, I have experience developing mobile, web and desktop applications whit the framework. I am constantly learning new technologies to improve my skills and deliver the best possible results. My GitHub profile showcases some of my personal projects.


I have a good understanding of the Flutter framework and its capabilities. I have worked on multiple projects, both personal and professional, and created high-performance, user-friendly cross-platform applications. My expertise in Flutter includes working with custom widgets, state management, and integrating with various APIs and services.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video-games such as __Destiny 2__ and Apex Legends with friends. Not only is it a fun and exciting hobby, but it also helps me to be a better developer. Playing video games requires quick thinking, teamwork, problem-solving skills and the ability to work well under pressure. Furthermore, being part of a team, helps me to better understand the importance of effective communication and cooperation in order to achieve a common goal. These are all qualities that translate well to the fast-paced and ever-changing world of software development.
